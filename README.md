A structured 8‑qubit entanglement network inspired by the conceptual composition “The Wolf and Owl’s Path: Multiple Syzygy of the Spirit’s Journey.”   The circuit models four interacting subsystems (Earth, Air, Water, Fire) and cross‑links that reflect the composition’s progression through grounding, elevation, renewal, and transformation.
